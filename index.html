      <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in Southern Africa famous for its natural beauty, peace and warm weather. It is the home to the great Victoria Falls, one of the 7 wonders of the world, and the famous big 5 animals of the jungle. Zimbabwe's economy thrives on mining and agriculture. Perhaps the most inviting feature in Zimbabwe are its people, who are known for their friendliness, honesty and love for peace and harmony. </p>
